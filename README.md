# Hello-World
Hello, I'm Winter 0019. I consider myself a pseudo-programmer with a keen interest in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the evolving privacy concerns in today's modern society. 
While I may not have extensive programming expertise, I am eager to learn and explore the realms of AI and its impact on privacy. Additionally, I mention being an "Oxen slave," which implies involvement or association with the Oxen project (also known as Session). 
Oxen is a privacy-focused decentralized communication platform built on the Loki blockchain, aiming to provide secure and private messaging services. 
As a session learner, you are likely invested in understanding and utilizing this platform to safeguard online communications.
With a combination of AI knowledge, privacy concerns, and an interest in programming, you have a unique perspective in navigating the realms of technology and privacy.
